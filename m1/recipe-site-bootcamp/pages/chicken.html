          3 tablespoons cooking oil (one tablespoon for marinating chicken)

        <li>1/2 tablespoon potato flour or cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon Shaoxing cooking wine</li>

      <p>Instructions</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Marinate the chicken with potato flour or cornstarch and add one
          tablespoon of oil to seal in the juice of the chicken. Set aside for
          10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat up your wok and add the remaining cooking oil into the wok. When
          the wok gets very hot and begins to smoke, add in the ginger and stir
          for a few seconds, then add the white part of the scallions and stir a
          few times. Add in the chicken and continue to stir well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Just when the chicken starts to cook through, add in the oyster sauce,
          sesame oil, cooking wine, white pepper, sugar, and toss the wok a few
          times. Add salt to taste, if it's not salty enough. Add in the green
          part of the scallion, stir quickly and remove from heat and serve
          immediately with steamed white rice.
        </li>
      </ol>
